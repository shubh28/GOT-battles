Hi my name is Shubham Jain. I am currently student in seventh semester doing B.Tech in IT branch from Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology.
I have solved this problem by using ReactJs at the front-end and NodeJs at the back-end.To run this project firstly you need to have the mysql database running with the table "battles" and all the dump data in it. Now to run the run the project yo need to navigate into the "REST" folder and the run command "npm start". (Make sure that you change the name of database accordingly in the config.js file).
After running the above command express server will be started and now you need to navigate into "frontend" folder and then run "npm start". After successful running of both the commands you are required to navigate to your browser and visit "localhost:8080" to run the application.
This is all how the project will run.

Since I am student in seventh semester only I wont be having the required experience for the job. But what I have is passion and hunger to learn. I have also done few projects like:

1. www.mytyles.com - In this project I have built the complete frontend from scratch using various frontend technologies like bootstrap,jquery,angularjs.

2. http://35.161.24.3/ - In this project also I have done the frontend part of the application.

3. http://admin.getmyparking.com/#/login - This is an admin dashboard which I built during my internship at getMyParking. This dashboard is built using angularjs.

4. https://github.com/shubh28/agile_scrum_tool - This is my minor project for the college. It is implemented using MEAN stack.

Thank you
